      <h2>
        <Golden>Chapter 1:</Golden> How to catch a pokemon
      </h2>
      <p>
        You know, at the start of a Pokemon game it's pretty easy. All you have
        to do is get your starter. But literally, the game gets harder and
        harder as you go on. So, <i>How do you catch a Pokemon?</i> you ask.
        This isn't always a tough question. Look, you see, just try to catch a
        ladyba. That's a really simple Pokemon to catch. It's hard to find, but
        really it's one of the weakest pokemon in the world. It's bug type. Bug
        types are weaker than fire types, weaker than water types, every type in
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the thing: how pokemon works... pokemon may be an easy game at
        times, depending on how you play. For example, I play pokemon sword, and
        I was really scared of going in the Galar mine. So, literally, I just
        stayed in the wild area. And eventually, I even did something silly. I
        stayed so long, I got a Garados to over level 40 before even getting a
        gym badge. Excuse me, I have five gym badges already now! I'm going to
        keep collecting. Pretty soon, I'll beat the game and get my mom to play
        the whole game next time.{" "}
        <i>
          Mom, that's actually true. Because I want you to be able to learn,
          so....
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, let's just start ripping up the chapters. We need to start
        learning, as you know. If you don't play pokemon and you're never going
        to, <i>please</i>, you don't need to care about any of this. But, read
        it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because, well, you might realize{" "}
        <i>actually, I want to play pokemon!</i> And then start playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, let's just start about catching a pokemon that is level 3.
        You can only find them at the start of your game, because each place in
        the game will give you a certain thingy with the pokemon for your level.
        Now, here's a tip on it.{" "}
        <i>(P.S. You will find tips in every chapter.)</i> Anyway,{" "}
        <Golden>
          TIP: There's a machamp in dusty bowl that wanders. It's level 43 or
          45, and there needs to be harsh sunlight for it to spawn.
        </Golden>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we're only going to be learning how to catch one pokemon. That
        means if you're not playing the right game, you won't be able to even
        get any knowledge on that game at all. Or, at least, not much. Either
        way, we're going to be doing a <i>Galar</i> pokemon.
      </p>
      <p>
        This pokemon is wooloo. Now, the easy part: you just use your starter.
        All you can have to do is attack and/or throw a pokeball. If this works,
        then you will have a new pokemon on your team. If it doesn't, try again!
        Do this strategy until it works, and don't let it faint. If it does, you
        can't catch it.
      </p>

      <h2>chapter 2: what is a pokemon?</h2>
      <p>
        What is a pokemon? actually, this is an easy question. Poke fact:
        pokemon stands for poket monster. Pokemon are inspired by insects,
        adventure, and collecting. Look, that doesn't mean i know everything
        about pokemon! Search more infomation up, I just don't feel like doing
        this.
